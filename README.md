### Advantages Of RSA Algorithm
- It uses Public Key encryption which means that
the text will be encrypted with someone's Public
Key (which everyone knows about) but only the
person intended for can read it, by using their
private key (which only they know about).
- Use of public key in RSA provides digital
signatures that cannot be repudiated.
- Ciphering & deciphering algorithm are same.
